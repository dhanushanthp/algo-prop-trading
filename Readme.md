# Automated Trading
Always treat the forex or stock market as gambling. Each time you enter a position, you can never be sure which direction it will move.

The most critical parts of trading are knowing:

what to trade,
when to trade,
when to enter and exit based on your chosen strategy.
Additionally, the price may move in your favor only after it hits the stop.

If you still think trading is a business despite these many unknown variables, then trading may not be for you. The only way to trade effectively is to remove emotion from the equation and trade like a robot. Stick to your target profit or loss, then call it a day. Don't let trades run indefinitely, as everyone advises.

And don't trade single positions at a time. Develop a strategy that allows you to enter multiple positions simultaneously. This way, some positions will move in your favor.
