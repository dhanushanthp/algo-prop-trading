# Automated Trading
I recommend automating trading instead of doing it manually. While it's possible for individuals to trade manually, emotions can negatively impact their decisions. For instance, a trader might gain confidence from a series of winning trades, not realizing that the market was simply favorable at that time. This confidence can lead to increased risk due to greed. If the market then reverses, the trader may not adapt, resulting in significant losses. Over time, this cycle can erode their confidence.


Emotions like greed and fear greatly influence this process. The best way to eliminate these emotions is by using a trading bot that makes decisions based on set rules, such as:

1. When to make a trade
2. Which symbol to trade
3. The risk level for each trade
4. Entry and exit plans


In trading, there's no single right or wrong approach. If a method works for you and brings in profit, that's what matters.

From my experience, I've learned that the market doesn't always move in one direction. Some trading experts suggest holding your position until the market closes if you're day trading. However, I believe it's better to develop a strategy that allows taking multiple positions simultaneously.
